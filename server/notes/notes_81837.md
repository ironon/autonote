# Session 2: Exploration and Colonization 
## The British Southern Colonies 

**The Southern Colonies**

- Made up of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia (and sometimes Maryland) 
- The first established British colonies in North America 
- Founded for purely economic reasons 

**The Southern Colonist**

1. The English Cavalier 
   - Economic Status: Wealthy landowning nobility 
   - Ethnic Background: English 
   - Where they Settled: Coastal lowlands in the east with the best land for large plantation farming

2. The Frontier Settler 
   - Economic Status: Poor former indentured servants 
   - Ethnic Background: Scotch-Irish, and poor English 
   - Where they settled: Small subsistence farms in the west near the Appalachians 

**The Jamestown Colony: 1607**

- First successful English colony in North America 
- Originally founded by the Virginia Company, a British joint-stock corporation 
- The colonists were led by John Smith, a former soldier and adventurer 
- Established as an economic venture, the settlement eventually became a royal colony controlled directly by the British Crown 

**Successes**

- New settlers arrived at the perfect time 
- Tobacco, introduced by John Rolfe in 1612, became profitable 
- Headright System solved labor issues; immigration expanded significantly 

**Problems**

- Everyone looking for gold and profit 
- Disease from bad water 
- Starvation - too many people looking for gold, not enough planting crops 
- Tense relations with the Powhatan Indians 
- "Starving Time" = winter of 1609-1610 

**Early Forms of Government**

- The Royal Colonies of the South (VA, NC, SC, GA) were governed by wealthy, land-owning aristocrats under the supervision of the King of England and Parliament 
- The Virginia House of Burgesses was the first elected colonial legislature in the Americas, established in 1619 
- The Virginia House of Burgesses still exists today as the Virginia Assembly, making it the oldest legislative system in the United States 

**European Treatment of Natives**

- The Spanish: Raised natives up into social and political life, banished their barbarism, changed their customs into humane ones, and taught them various useful arts 
- The French: Exceeded in industry, economy, and the arts of conciliating the affections of mankind; focused on commerce rather than agriculture 
- The English: Sought to change the native's "barbarous natures," teach them about the true God and salvation, and make them obedient to the king's Majesty and his Governors 

**The Settlers Clash with Native Americans**

- Relations with American Indians got worse over time 
- No intermarriage like the Spanish 
- Colonists wanted more land for tobacco, Native Americans resisted 
- 1622 - Opechancanough’s revolt wiped out 1/3 of VA settlers; King James revoked the company’s charter 
- 1624 - VA became a royal colony 

**Economy of the South**

- Geographic Condition: Low coastal plain in the east and foothills and mountains in the west 
- Cash Crops: Tobacco, Rice, and Indigo (NO COTTON YET!) 
- Labor Force: Indentured servants and later slaves 
- Class Division: The wealthy owned plantations, the poor hunted and relied on subsistence farming and trade with the natives 

**The Indentured Servant**

- How they arrived: Most indentured servants came over via the "headright system" (a system in which anyone who paid their own way or another’s to the New World received 50 acres of land) 
- Length of service: Indentured servants had to labor for 4-7 years before being freed and gain ownership of their land 
- Ethnic Make-up: Poor English, Scot-Irish, and African 

**African Slavery**

- How they Arrived: Slaves began arriving in the 17th century from Africa via the "middle passage" (part of the triangular trade from Africa to the Americas) 
- Length of Service: Slaves had a life term 
- Ethnic Make-Up: African 

**Impact of the Slave Trade**

- Disease killing native populations led to the demand for African slaves 
- African slavery offered a stable workforce resistant to European diseases 
- Trans-Atlantic slave trade grew quickly, becoming a key part of the new American economic system 

**Economic Differences Split Virginia**

- Wealthy "cavalier" planters in Eastern VA with lots of land and money, represented by Governor Berkeley 
- Former indentured servants in Western VA and the frontier with no land, no money, and no protection from Natives, represented by Nathaniel Bacon 

**Bacon's Rebellion**

- Poor whites in the west, including former indentured servants, revolted against VA gov’t due to lack of protection from Native Americans and lack of representation in the House of Burgesses 
- The revolt led to more planters choosing African slaves over indentured servants due to the reduced likelihood of revolt 

**Social and Religious**

- Social Structure: Dominated by family status and land ownership 
- Land Ownership: The wealthy owned plantations with slaves, the poor lived on the frontier 
- Political Structure: The aristocracy (wealthy elites) controlled the government 
- Religious Affiliation: Anglican (Church of England)
