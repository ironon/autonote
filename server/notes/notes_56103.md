# Session 2: Exploration and Colonization - THE BRITISH SOUTHERN COLONIES

## The Southern Colonies
- Made up of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia (and sometimes Maryland)
- The first established British colonies in North America
- Founded for purely economic reasons

## The Southern Colonist
### The English Cavalier
- Economic Status: Wealthy landowning nobility
- Ethnic Background: English
- Where they Settled: Coastal lowlands in the east with the best land for large plantation farming.

### The Frontier Settler
- Economic Status: Poor former indentured servants
- Ethnic Background: Scotch-Irish, and poor English
- Where they Settled: Small subsistence farms in the west near the Appalachians.

## The Jamestown Colony: 1607
- First successful English colony in North America.
- Originally founded by the Virginia Company, a British joint-stock corporation.
- The colonists were led by John Smith, a former soldier and adventurer.
- Established as an economic venture, the settlement eventually became a royal colony controlled directly by the British Crown.

### Successes
- New settlers arrived at the perfect time.
- Introduction of tobacco in 1612 by John Rolfe.
- Headright System - solved labor issues, increased immigration.
 
### Problems
- Everyone looking for gold and profit.
- Disease from bad water.
- Starvation due to the focus on gold instead of crops.
- Tense relations with the Powhatan Indians.
- "Starving Time" during the winter of 1609-1610.

## Early Forms of Government
- The Royal Colonies of the South (VA, NC, SC, GA) were governed by wealthy, land-owning aristocrats under the supervision of the King of England and Parliament.
- The Virginia House of Burgesses, established in 1619, was the first elected colonial legislature in the Americas.
- The Virginia House of Burgesses still exists today as the Virginia Assembly, making it the oldest legislative system in the United States.

## European Treatment of Natives
### The Spanish
- Raised natives up into social and political life, changed customs, and introduced useful arts and knowledge.
### The French
- Excelling in industry, economy, and conciliating the affections of the Indians.
### The English
- Intend to change the natives' barbarous nature, introduce them to the true god, and enforce obedience to the kings Majesty and his Governors in those parts.

## The Settlers Clash with Native Americans
- Relations with American Indians got worse over time.
- No intermarriage like the Spanish.
- Colonists wanted more land for tobacco, Native Americans resisted.
- 1622 - Opechancanough’s revolt wiped out 1/3 of VA settlers, leading to King James revoking the company’s charter in 1624.
- Virginia became a royal colony.
 
## Economy of the South
- Geographic Condition: Low coastal plain in the east and foothills and mountains in the west.
- Charleston, SC became one of the few major trade ports in the South.
- Cash Crops: Tobacco, Rice, and Indigo (NO COTTON YET!)
- Labor Force: Indentured servants and later slaves worked on large plantations.
- Class Division: The wealthy owned plantations, the poor hunted and relied on subsistence farming and trade with the natives.

## The Indentured Servant
- Arrived through the headright system.
- Served for 4-7 years before gaining ownership of their own land.
- Ethnic make-up: Poor English, Scot-Irish, and African.

## African Slavery
- Arrived via the middle passage in the 17th century.
- Enslaved for life.
- Ethnic make-up: African.

## Impact of the Slave Trade
- Disease killed native populations, making African slavery a more stable workforce.
- Demand for African labor grew quickly, leading to the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
- By the early 1800s, 12 million Africans were taken from Africa.

## Economic Differences Split Virginia
- Wealthy "cavalier" planters in Eastern VA represented by Governor Berkeley.
- Former indentured servants in Western VA and frontier represented by Nathaniel Bacon.
 
### Bacon’s Rebellion
- Poor whites in the west revolted against the VA government.
- Reasons for revolt:
  - Lack of protection from Native Americans
  - Lack of representation in the House of Burgesses
- Resulted in burning of Jamestown and influenced more planters to choose African slaves.

## Social and Religious Structure
- Social Structure Dominated by family status and land ownership.
- Land Ownership: The wealthy owned plantations with slaves, the poor lived on the frontier.
- Political Structure: The aristocracy controlled the government.
- Religious Affiliation: Anglican (Church of England)
