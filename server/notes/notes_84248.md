# Session 2: Exploration and Colonization

## The Southern Colonies
- Made up of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia (sometimes Maryland)
- First established British colonies in North America
- Founded for economic reasons

## The Southern Colonists
### The English Cavalier
- Economic Status: Wealthy landowning nobility
- Ethnic Background: English
- Where they Settled: Coastal lowlands in the east with the best land for large plantation farming

### The Frontier Settler
- Economic Status: Poor former indentured servants
- Ethnic Background: Scotch-Irish and poor English
- Where they Settled: Small subsistence farms in the west near the Appalachians

## The Jamestown Colony: 1607
- First successful English colony in North America
- Originally founded by the Virginia Company, a British joint-stock corporation
- Colonists led by John Smith, a former soldier and adventurer
- Established as an economic venture, eventually became a royal colony controlled directly by the British Crown
- Succeeded due to John Smith's leadership and the profitability of tobacco
- Joint-stock companies funded and maintained the first English colonies through private investment and with charters from the English government
- Virginia Company founded Jamestown in 1607

### Successes
- New settlers arrived at the perfect time
- Introduction of tobacco in 1612 by John Rolfe
- Headright System - solved labor issues, increased immigration

### Problems
- Everyone looking for gold and profit
- Disease from bad water
- Starvation due to focus on gold rather than planting crops
- Tense relations with the Powhatan Indians
- "Starving Time" - winter of 1609-1610

## Early Forms of Government
- The Southern Royal Colonies (VA, NC, SC, GA) were governed by wealthy, land-owning aristocrats under the supervision of the King of England and Parliament
- The Virginia House of Burgesses, established in 1619, was the first elected colonial legislature in the Americas and still exists today as the Virginia Assembly

## European Treatment of Natives
### The Spanish
- Raised natives up into social and political life, teaching them useful skills (Juan de Solorzano Pereyra)

### The French
- Exceed in industry, economy, and the arts of conciliating the affections of mankind; peddling commerce flourishes (Edmund Burke)

### The English
- Change their barbarous natures, inform them of the true god and salvation, teach them obedience to the king's Majesty and his Governors (Sir William Strachey)

## The Settlers Clash with Native Americans
- Relations with American Indians worsened over time
- No intermarriage like the Spanish
- Colonists wanted more land for tobacco, Native Americans resisted
- 1622 - Opechancanough's revolt wiped out 1/3 of VA settlers, King James revoked the company's charter
- 1624 - VA became a royal colony under the direct control of the king

## Economy of the South
- Geographic Condition: Low coastal plain in the east and foothills and mountains in the west
- Major trade port in the South - Charleston, SC
- Cash Crops: Tobacco, Rice, and Indigo (no cotton yet)
- Labor Force: Indentured servants and later slaves on large plantations
- Class Division: Wealthy owned plantations, poor relied on subsistence farming and trade with the natives

## The Indentured Servant
- Arrived through the headright system
- Length of service: 4-7 years before freedom and ownership of land
- Ethnic Make-up: Poor English, Scot-Irish, and African

## African Slavery
- Arrived via the middle passage in the 17th century
- Slaves had life terms
- Ethnic Make-Up: African

## Impact of the Slave Trade
- Disease killed native populations, African slavery became alternative labor
- Demand for slaves grew quickly, trans-Atlantic slave trade grew quickly as a key part of the new American economic system

## Economic Differences Split Virginia
- Wealthy "cavalier" planters in Eastern VA - represented by Governor Berkeley
- Former indentured servants in Western VA and frontier - represented by Nathaniel Bacon

## Bacon's Rebellion
- Poor whites revolted against VA government
- Resented lack of protection from Native Americans and lack of representation in the House of Burgesses
- Marched on and burned Jamestown
- Led to more planters choosing African slaves over indentured servants

## Social and Religious
- Social Structure dominated by family status and land ownership
- Land Ownership: Wealthy owned plantations with slaves, poor lived on the frontier
- Political Structure: Aristocracy controlled the government
- Religious Affiliation: Anglican (Church of England)
