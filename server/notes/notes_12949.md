# Session 2: Exploration and Colonization: The British Southern Colonies

## The Southern Colonies
- Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and sometimes Maryland
- First established British colonies in North America
- Founded for economic reasons

## The Southern Colonist
### The English Cavalier
- Economic Status: Wealthy landowning nobility
- Ethnic Background: English
- Where they Settled: Coastal lowlands in the east with the best land for large plantation farming

### The Frontier Settler
- Economic Status: Poor former indentured servants
- Ethnic Background: Scotch-Irish and poor English
- Where they settled: Small subsistence farms in the west near the Appalachians

## The Jamestown Colony: 1607
- First successful English colony in North America
- Originally founded by the Virginia Company, a British joint-stock corporation
- Led by John Smith, a former soldier and adventurer
- Established as an economic venture, eventually became a royal colony controlled by the British Crown

### Successes
- New settlers arrived at the perfect time
- Introduction of tobacco by John Rolfe in 1612
- Headright System solved labor issues by providing 50 acres for any plantation owner who paid for passage of a laborer, leading to increased immigration

### Problems
- Everyone looking for gold and profit
- Disease and starvation due to lack of farming
- Tense relations with the Powhatan Indians
- "Starving Time" during the winter of 1609-1610

## Early Forms of Government
- The Royal Colonies of the South (VA, NC, SC, GA) governed by wealthy, land-owning aristocrats under the supervision of the King of England and Parliament
- The Virginia House of Burgesses, established in 1619, was the first elected colonial legislature in the Americas and still exists today as the Virginia Assembly

## European Treatment of Natives
### The Spanish
- Raised natives up into social and political life
- Introduced cultivation of the soil, building houses, living in towns, reading, writing, and other arts
- Source: Juan de Solorzano Pereyra, Politica Indiana

### The French
- Exceeded in industry, economy, and the arts of conciliating the affections of mankind
- Had a country where more is to be affected by managing the Indians than by cultivating the ground
- Source: Edmund Burke, An Account of European Settlements in America

### The English
- Goal was to change the natives' barbarous natures, inform them of the true god, and teach them obedience to the kings Majesty and his Governors
- Source: Sir William Strachey, The imperial goal of England in History and Travel

## The Settlers Clash with Native Americans
- Relations with American Indians worsened over time
- No intermarriage like the Spanish
- Colonists wanted more land for tobacco, Native Americans resisted
- 1622: Opechancanough's revolt wiped out 1/3 of VA settlers, leading to the revocation of the company's charter and the establishment of VA as a royal colony

## Economy of the South
- Geographic Condition: Low coastal plain in the east and foothills and mountains in the west
- Cash Crops: Tobacco, Rice, and Indigo (no cotton yet)
- Labor Force: Indentured servants and later slaves
- Class Division: The wealthy owned plantations, the poor relied on subsistence farming and trade with the natives

## The Indentured Servant
- Arrived through the headright system
- Length of service: 4-7 years before gaining freedom and land ownership
- Ethnic Make-up: Poor English, Scot-Irish, and African

## African Slavery
- Arrived through the middle passage, part of the triangular trade from Africa to the Americas
- Life-term of service
- Ethnic Make-up: African

## Impact of the Slave Trade
- Disease killed native populations, leading to African slavery being an alternative for labor
- Demand for slaves grew quickly, contributing to the trans-Atlantic slave trade becoming a key part of the new American economic system
- 12 million people were taken from Africa by the early 1800s

## Economic Differences Split Virginia
- Wealthy "cavalier" planters in Eastern VA, represented by Governor Berkeley
- Former indentured servants in Western VA and the frontier, represented by Nathaniel Bacon
- Bacon's Rebellion: Poor whites revolted against the VA government due to lack of protection from Native Americans and lack of representation in the House of Burgesses

## Social and Religious
- Social Structure: Dominated by family status and land ownership
- Land Ownership: The wealthy owned plantations with slaves, the poor lived on the frontier
- Political Structure: Controlled by the aristocracy (wealthy elites)
- Religious Affiliation: Anglican (Church of England)
