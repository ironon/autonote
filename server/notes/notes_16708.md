# Session 2: Exploration and Colonization - THE BRITISH SOUTHERN COLONIES

## The Southern Colonies
- Made up of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia (and sometimes Maryland)
- The first established British colonies in North America
- Founded for purely economic reasons

## The Southern Colonist
### The English Cavalier
- Economic Status: Wealthy landowning nobility
- Ethnic Background: English
- Where they Settled: Coastal lowlands in the east with the best land for large plantation farming.

### The Frontier Settler
- Economic Status: Poor former indentured servants
- Ethnic Background: Scotch-Irish and poor English
- Where they settled: Small subsistence farms in the west near the Appalachians.

## The Jamestown Colony: 1607
- First successful English colony in North America.
- Originally founded by the Virginia Company, a British joint-stock corporation.
- The colonists were led by John Smith, a former soldier and adventurer.
- Established as an economic venture, the settlement eventually became a royal colony controlled directly by the British Crown.

### Successes
- New settlers arrived at perfect time.
- Introduction of tobacco by John Rolfe in 1612.
- Headright System solved labor issues.
- Immigration expanded significantly.

### Problems
- Everyone looking for gold and profit.
- Disease from bad water.
- Starvation due to lack of crops.
- Tense relations with the Powhatan Indians.
- "Starving Time" during the winter of 1609-1610.

## Early Forms of Government
- The Royal Colonies of the South (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia) were governed by wealthy, land-owning aristocrats under the supervision of the King of England and Parliament.
- The Virginia House of Burgesses was the first elected colonial legislature in the Americas, established in 1619.
- The Virginia House of Burgesses still exists today as the Virginia Assembly, making it the oldest legislative system in the United States.

## European Treatment of Natives
### The Spanish
- Raised the natives up into social and political life.
- Banished their barbarism and changed their customs.
- Taught them various useful arts and skills.
- Introduced cultivation of the soil, building houses, living in towns, reading, writing, and more.

### The French
- Exceeded in industry, economy, and the arts of conciliating the affections of mankind.
- Managed the Indians for personal gain.
- Flourished in peddling commerce and obedience to wise government.

### The English
- Planned to change the natives' barbarous natures, inform them of the true god and salvation, and teach them obedience to the king's majesty and governors in those parts.

## The Settlers Clash with Native Americans
- Relations with American Indians got worse over time.
- No intermarriage like the Spanish.
- Colonists wanted more land for tobacco, while Native Americans resisted.
- Opechancanough's revolt in 1622 wiped out 1/3 of VA settlers and led to the revocation of the company's charter.
- Virginia became a royal colony in 1624.

## Economy of the South
- Geographic Condition: Low coastal plain in the east and foothills and mountains in the west. Charleston, SC became one of the few major trade ports in the South.
- Cash Crops: Tobacco, Rice, and Indigo (NO COTTON YET!)
- Labor Force: Indentured servants and later slaves to work large plantations.
- Class Division: The wealthy owned plantations, the poor hunted and relied on subsistence farming and trade with the natives.

## The Indentured Servant
- Arrived via the "headright system" (anyone who paid their own way or another's to the New World received 50 acres of land).
- Length of service: 4-7 years before being freed and gaining ownership of their own land.
- Ethnic Make-up: Poor English, Scot-Irish, and African.

## African Slavery
- Slaves arrived in the 17th century from Africa via the "middle passage" of the triangular trade.
- Slaves had a life term of service.
- Ethnic Make-up: African.

## Impact of the Slave Trade
- Disease killed native populations and African slavery became an alternative for labor.
- Demands for slaves grew quickly, leading to the growth of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
- By the early 1800s, 12 million people had been taken from Africa.

## Economic Differences Split Virginia
- Wealthy "cavalier" planters in Eastern VA - had land and money, represented by Governor Berkeley.
- Former indentured servants in Western VA and the frontier - had no land, no money, and no protection from Natives, represented by Nathaniel Bacon.

## Bacon's Rebellion
- Poor whites in the west revolted against the VA government.
- Reasons for the revolt: Resented lack of protection from Native Americans and lack of representation in the House of Burgesses.
- Resulted in the burning of Jamestown and increased the use of African slaves over indentured servants.

## Social and Religious
- Social Structure: Dominated by family status and land ownership.
- Land Ownership: The wealthy owned plantations with slaves, the poor lived on the frontier.
- Political Structure: The aristocracy (wealthy elites) controlled the government.
- Religious Affiliation: Anglican (Church of England)
